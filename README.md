# ice-volume-visualization
This repository contains a set of tools and scripts in Python for analyzing and visualizing Arctic sea ice volume. Using historical ice volume data collected by the PIOMAS project, this project provides different options for plotting and exploring changes in sea ice over time. It includes functions for generating plots by month, by year, and for visualizing all available data. This tool is valuable for researchers, climate scientists, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of Arctic sea ice and its relationship to climate change. Explore, analyze, and visualize Arctic sea ice volume easily and effectively with this repository!
